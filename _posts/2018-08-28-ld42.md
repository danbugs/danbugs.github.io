## INTRODUCTION

Before we get into the _jiggity jig_ of the game, I wanted to present you with 90% of the conversations I had with my friends that played the game:

> Hey Dan! I think object distribution and generation is really bad. Objects just spawn right in front of me not giving me time to dodge.

>> Hey random friend! My game is **just like Dark Souls** deal with it.

_Laughter, Laughter, Cries of Laughter, and Claps_


Alright, now that I've made you laugh like you haven't in years let's put the jokes aside. I wanted to let you know that I had very little time to make all of this. During this Ludum Dare Event (which happens to be my first) I had to make a long trip to the airport, meet up with family friends and celebrate two family parties. Due to this and still having to make the music and graphics, I had to sacrifice a bunch of time from coding and testing. I probably coded this in 6 hours so take it for what it is.

## CONCEPT

This game is inspired by the story Inferno by Dan Brown and the story Inferno by Dante Alighieri. The world is suffering by overpopulation. To fix it, a gas virus was spread all over the globe. To avoid it, you try to escape to hell (inferno) by throwing yourself in an endless ditch full of obstacles that you have to avoid.

## GAMEPLAY

## HOW TO PLAY

- Avoid the obstacles as you fall.
- Use `A and D` or `LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys` to move.
- You cannot move vertically.
- ProTip‚Ñ¢: There is a certain spot you can stay where you will never get hit. Find it and you will fall forever (~~what a dream come true, right?~~)

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank _Bia Gasc√≥n_, my girlfriend, for being my main source of inspiration for the piece.

(Ps. I swear, it is not her fault that it came out the way it did, she just helped with the story)
